Fresh off the heels of the first annual [**MUD Coders Guild Game Jam**](https://itch.io/jam/enterthemud/results) and nobody lost an eye! Since this was not only the first TMCG game jam, but also my own personal first game jam, I thought it important to write up what we did right, what we did wrong, and what we could have done better.

### The Good

Let’s start with **The Good**. Despite my inexperience, the TMCG game jam wasn’t a total disaster! There were a few things that went incredibly well—although, full disclosure, they had almost nothing to do with me.

#### Community

The MUD Coders Guild is one of the most engaging and welcoming communities I have ever had the good fortune to be apart of. I want to take a second and thank every single member—both new and old—for their support and encouragement as we continue to grow.

#### Submissions

Despite my own personal failings (see: **The Bad** ), the submissions we received were some of the most impressive MUDs I have ever seen. The level of creativity and skill that each submission exhibited was beyond my wildest expectations for the jam. I can’t wait to see what we receive next year!

### The Bad

When it comes down to it, **The Bad** falls right on my head. There is a lot that I could have done better, but thankfully they are mistakes that I can learn from for next time.

#### Rules & Regulations

If I’m being perfectly honest, I went a little overboard with the rules. While the intent was to be organized, they ended up establishing some unrealistic limits: namely a minimum vote threshold. Because only one game actually _hit_the 10-vote limit, I’ve dropped that requirement, but in the future I think we will put a little more thought into the consequences of each rule, and throw out ones we don’t absolutely _need_.

#### Marketing & Outreach

I suck at marketing. Who’da thunk, right? While there’s not much I can do to improve my marketing skills—once an engineer, always an engineer—for next year’s jam I intend to spend a little more time up-front planning a marketing and outreach strategy to increase submissions, voters, and maybe drum up some sponsorships.

#### Time Management

Running an online community is an incredibly busy job, and apparently adding a game jam onto that workload doesn’t make anything easier. Right in line with **Marketing & Outreach** , I plan to spend more time planning up front to make sure next year’s jam goes off without a hitch.

### The Ugly

And finally… **The Ugly**. Thankfully, there’s really only one thing in this category that was less a mistake, and more a “lesson learned” for next time.

#### Itch.io

[Itch.io](http://itch.io/) is an awesome platform, and an incredibly popular one for running game jams. Unfortunately, Itch.io is not designed for the type of game MUDs are. Because Itch.io expects a downloadable or HTML-based game, this required participants to get creative in the way they crafted their submissions; which sucked.

Next year, I plan to come up with a more MUD-friendly submission system for our game jam, whether it is a different platform, or a completely custom solution. If you have any ideas, please let me know!

### Conclusion

While there were a few lessons learned, ultimately I would say that our first attempt at running a game jam was a success! We have year-ish until the next one, so I for one plan on taking that time to better plan for it. It was a fun experience, and one I intend to repeat!
