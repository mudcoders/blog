Earlier this year, I set out to create a community for programmers with a passion for creating multi-user dungeons (also known as MUDs). Because of its popularity, I landed on building the community on Slack (despite the lack of built-in “auto-invite” functionality).

Since the guild’s creation, we’ve managed to grow into a small but supportive community of software developers who continually bond over our love for text-based game design and development; and the willingness of each and every member to help each other out (from job referrals to code reviews to general career advice) is something that I could never have predicted.

So, if you’re a software developer with a desire to create online text-based games, join us! We’d love to have you [join our Slack](https://slack.mudcoders.com/) community!
