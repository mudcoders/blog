At The MUD Coders Guild, we are always experimenting, building, and learning. As a passionate group of software developers and software development hobbyists, staying on top of the resources, tutorials, and projects we come across has become difficult to do. As a result, I am proud to announce the creation of [The MUD Coders Guild Newsletter](https://mudcoders.substack.com/), a monthly digest of text-based game development successes, failures, inspiration, and anecdotes from the members of The MUD Coders Guild.

The purpose of this newsletter is to share the resources we are inspired by, as well as the projects we are driven to create. Have something to interesting you would like to share with the community? Join us on [Slack](https://slack.mudcoders.com/) and let us know, and don’t forget to subscribe at [mudcoders.substack.com](https://mudcoders.substack.com/).

We’d love to have you!
